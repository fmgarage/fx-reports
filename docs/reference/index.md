## Reference

Here, you can find the objects and the syntax needed for writing json templates for **FX Reports**. It is roughly organized like a template is structured, with document-wide setting and definitions first, followed by the elements/parts that a document consists of (top to bottom) and finally some more complex objects that can be used in different places in the template.

### Structure


#### custom definitions

- [Print Options](/reference/print/)
- [Font Definition](/reference/font/)
- [Format Definition](/reference/format/)
- [Pictures Definition](/reference/pictures/)

#### document objects

- [Workbook](/reference/workbook/)
- [Sheet](/reference/sheet/)
- [Column](/reference/column/)
- [Row](/reference/row/)
- [Cell](/reference/cell/)

#### abstract objects

- [Case Object](/reference/case/)
- [Color Object](/reference/color/)
- [Picture Object](/reference/picture/)
