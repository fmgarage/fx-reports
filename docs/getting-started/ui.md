## User Interfaces

FX Reports provides 2 different modes for interaction.

1. GUI

By using the graphical user interface it is easy to achieve results in a minimum of time. Templates can be written right in the editor window of FX_Reports or - useful for more complex tasks/outputs - pasted from an external [editor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link writing-templates/tools.md %}). With a click on `Generate xlsx`, the document will be generated.

1. API

When using FX Reports professionally, you might want to integrate it into your application. With an easy-to-use API you provide a template and call one script to generate the document.
