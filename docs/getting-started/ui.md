## Using the UI

FX Reports provides a GUI for simple interactions.

It is easy to achieve results in a minimum of time by using the graphical user interface. Templates can be written right in the editor window of **FX Reports** or - useful for more complex tasks/outputs - pasted from an external [editor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link writing-templates/tools.md %}).

With a click on `Generate xlsx`, the document will be generated.

To check if your template is free of errors, click on `Validate Template`.

In the settings tab, you can enter license keys for **FX Reports** and both dependencies, MBS and LibXL.

### API

When using **FX Reports** at scale, you might want to integrate it into your application. With an easy-to-use API you only need to provide a template and call one script to generate the document.

Read next how to integrate **FX Reports** and use the API: [Integration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/integration.md %})
