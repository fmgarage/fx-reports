### MBS Plugin

If an MBS license is already active in your own/main application, you don't need to register again in FX Reports.

If you are not using MBS in your application, registration of a license is possible by either entering the license key and user info in the FX Reports Settings User Interface:

TODO one screenshot of settings with all 3 options marked, where to place?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/regLicense.png" style="width: 50%; magin-bottom: 20px;">


...or by calling the API:

```
TODO

FX_Reports::setLicenseMbs($parameter)

```


### LibXL

Activating LibXL works similar to activating MBS: via UI or via API.

TODO maybe combined article with MBS?

...


```
TODO

FX_Reports::setLicenseLibxl($parameter)

```
