## JSON Schema

This is the JSON schema file. It is used internally to validate any template that is being processed. You can also use the schema for designing templates. Most IDEs have a built-in support for schemas when editing JSON. You can also use https://json-editor.github.io/json-editor to compose your templates. 

We are also working on internal support for editing templates in an upcoming version of **FX_Reports**.
