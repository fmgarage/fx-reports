Generate fully featured Excel spreadsheets from FileMaker.




#### What does 'FX' stand for? 

All our **FileMaker**-based projects and products are prefixed with an **F**, the **X** stands for **extension** or **extract**. FX files are modules that you can simply add to your own solution and they mostly contain classes and functionality taken from our **F1 Framework**.

FX modules are mostly closed source, i.e. the admin account is removed. They are free to use or have at least a free tier. Extra functionality can then be unlocked by purchasing a license.
