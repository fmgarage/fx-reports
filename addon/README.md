## FX Reports AddOn



#### How to install

On double-clicking the **FX_Reports.fmaddon** file, FileMaker will install an FX_Reports folder in the AddonModules directory. The .fmaddon file can now be deleted. Alternatively can copy the FX_Reports folder from the repository to AddonModules manually.
